# Base64 Encoding Options
Encoding binary data to [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) is a common operation in the programming world. Simplest [use case](https://stackoverflow.com/a/201510) is probably to transport binary data over the network in common encoding so it doesn't get currupt while being processed by different systems. There are more [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64#Implementations_and_history), some of them are also mentioned in examples bellow.

In this article we will go over the different encoding options provided in Apple's [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation) framework as part of the [`Data`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data) object.

## Example Data
In the examples bellow, example data is encoded using [`base64EncodedString(options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/1413546-base64encodedstring) instance method on `Data`. Same options can be applied with [`base64EncodedData(options:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/1412739-base64encodeddata).

To keep it simple, example data is one hundreed 1s generated like so:
```swift
let data = Data(repeating: 1, count: 100)
```

## No Options - `[]`
Default and most commonly used operation. Encodes data without any options and returns the result as a single line string. 

###### Usage
```swift
data.base64EncodedString()
```

###### Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQ==
```

## Line Lengths
Line length options give us the posibility to limit the amount of characters before a line ending is inserted.

> ⚠️ Only one line length option should be provided, otherwise all options are ignored and the result is returned on a single line.

### 64 Characters - [`lineLength64Characters`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/base64encodingoptions/1407872-linelength64characters)
Common use case of having line length limited to 64 characters is in the privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) standard which is nowadays mostly used to transport certificates and cryptographic keys over the network. You can read more about it in the _Printable Encoding_ section of [RFC 1421](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1421#section-4.3.2.4). 

###### Usage
```swift
data.base64EncodedString(options: .lineLength64Characters)
```

###### Pretty Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB
AQEBAQ==
```

###### Raw Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\r\nAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\r\nAQEBAQ==
```

Inserts a line ending in form of `\r\n` every 64 characters. We'll get to what `\r\n` means and how it can be modified in the Line Endings section.

### 76 Characters - [`lineLength76Characters`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/base64encodingoptions/1413700-linelength76characters)
Common use case of 76 character line length is for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) standard which is used to transport email messages. Check out the _Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding_ section of [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8) for more information.

###### Usage
```swift
data.base64EncodedString(options: .lineLength76Characters)
```

###### Pretty Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQ==
```

###### Raw Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\r\nAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQ==
```

Similar as `lineLength64Characters`, except a line ending is inserted every 76 characters.

## Line Endings
Prerequisite for line ending options to have an effect is to pair them with one of the line length options, otherwise the result is a single line string and no line endings are inserted. By default all (two) line ending options are enabled as shown in Line Length examples. 

The following examples use `lineLength64Characters` as a line length option. For that reason pretty results are not shown on a per option basis since they all look the same:

AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB
AQEBAQ==
```

### Carriage Return - [`endLineWithCarriageReturn`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/base64encodingoptions/1407202-endlinewithcarriagereturn)
[Carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return) - `\r`. Control character from the typewriter era that is somehow still around even though its purpose in the modern technology days seems questionable.

###### Usage
```swift
data.base64EncodedString(options: [.lineLength64Characters, .endLineWithCarriageReturn])
```

###### Raw Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\rAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\rAQEBAQ==
```

### Line Feed - [`endLineWithLineFeed`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdata/base64encodingoptions/1415882-endlinewithlinefeed)
Newline as most of us are familiar with: `\n`. Useful when dealing with cryptographic entities such as keys and certificates since they are mostly transported in PEM format which defines 64 character long lines separated by a line feed.

###### Usage
```swift
data.base64EncodedString(options: [.lineLength64Characters, .endLineWithLineFeed])
```

###### Raw Result
```no-highlight
AQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\nAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEB\nAQEBAQ==
```
